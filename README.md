# Real-time Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV
The objective of this project is to implement real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV. The project involves capturing frames from a webcam, converting them to grayscale, and using Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces and eyes in the image. The project is implemented in Python using the OpenCV library.
